  - Overpay for marquee media companies

- Quote from COO Burke: "My job was to create the free cash flow, and Murphy's was to spend it"

- On decentralization:
  - "There is a fundamental humility to decentralization, an admission that HQ does not have all the answers and that much of the real value is created by local managers in the field."
  - This resulted in low turnover:
    - "The system in place corrupts you with so much autonomy and authority that you can't imagine leaving"

- On Media & Ads
  - "While you couldn't control your revenues at a TV station, you could control your costs"
  - "The best defense against revenue lumpiness inherent in ad-supported businesses was constant vigilence on costs"

- On capital allocation:
  - "Capital Cities was extremely acquisitive, three separate times doing the largest deal in the history of the broadcast industry"
  - Murphy: "I got paid not just to make deals, but to make *good* deals."
  - Several acquisitions represented 25% or more of the company's market cap at the time they were made
  - Benchmark was double-digit after tax returns over 10 years without leverage
  - Exercised share buybacks when company's multiple was low compared to market
