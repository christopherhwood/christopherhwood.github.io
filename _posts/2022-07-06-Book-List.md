[The Outsiders](https://www.amazon.com/Outsiders-Unconventional-Radically-Rational-Blueprint-ebook/dp/B009G1T74O) - Currently reading. Goal is to better understand good capital allocation + different ways of approaching work & life.

[Apartment by Teddy Wayne](https://www.amazon.com/Apartment/dp/B084HMLMS2/) - Quick page turner, got me hooked and back into reading regularly. Pretty good environment building without being overwhelming, and good job of describing characters' feelings without being too obvious.
