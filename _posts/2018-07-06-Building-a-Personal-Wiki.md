I'm going to try something new. I would like to build a personal wiki, something like what Roam Research is trying to offer or many other note-taking apps aspire to do. I've tried this before, previously my first thoughts were how to build an app that could support my use case. I would end up getting caught up in trying to build a new app and because of that avoid taking notes until the app was ready. Eventually I'd be overwhelmed by the work needed and frustrated that I can't just start taking notes on what I'm reading, and put the idea back in the backlog.
This time, I'm going to start taking notes first using just regular old html. As I find limitations, I'll try to fix them. Maybe I'll come up with something cool that others can use too, or maybe not. At least I'll be able to keep my own notes in the meantime though!
