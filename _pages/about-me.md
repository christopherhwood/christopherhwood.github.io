Hi, I'm Chris. Thanks for visiting my website. Below is a little more info about me and what I do. I love hearing from people - feel free to reach out on Twitter, Wechat (\_woodrow), or email (christopherhwood [at] gmail dot com).   

## iOS Developer - DayDayCook (日日煮) ##  

 Since January of 2016 I have been leading DayDayCook's iOS development team from their headquarters office in Shanghai. The DayDayCook app has been featured on Apple's homepage numerous times since the global launching of the app in June, 2016. The app is widely recognized as one of the best designed and most innovative recipe apps within the APAC region, and in 2016 was named one of the Top Ten apps on the Hong Kong App Store, by the App Store itself.   

The DayDayCook app is unique in its use of various iOS technologies. Last year I independently built DayDayCook's Apple Watch, Apple TV, and iMessage apps. The core DayDayCook app is usable on the full range of iPhones and iPads with iOS 9.0 and above.   

## Other Technologies ##  

In my spare time, I like to study new technologies. Recently, I have been focused on learning about OpenGL, image processing, Apple's ARKit, and convolutional neural networks. I am also very interested in the research being done by human-computer interaction researchers Alan Kay, Bret Victor, and Nicky Case.   

## Long Term Goals ##  

A long term goal of mine is to create a new medium for online communication that is designed 100% for the digital era. I would like to see blog posts, books, and online courses restructured to take maximum use of their digital environments - using more code and less static content.  

## About China ##  

I live and work in Shanghai, China. I have been here for 4 years, since graduating from the University of Virginia in 2013 with a double major in Mandarin Chinese and Economics. I have spent one year in Nanjing at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center, where I completed a graduate certificate in International Relations, followed by three years in Shanghai largely spent working with early-stage Chinese startups.
