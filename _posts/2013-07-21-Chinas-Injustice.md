### The story behind the July 20, 2013 Beijing airport bomber

On the morning of July 20, 2013, Ji Zhongxing (冀中星) wheeled his wheelchair by the B exit in terminal three of the Beijing airport and detonated a homemade bomb made out of black powder. Considering the sensitive nature of airports, and the dangerousness of igniting an explosive device inside possibly the busiest airport in the world, this should very well be deemed an act of terror. However, the story behind what drove Ji Zhongxing to ignite his homemade bomb also deserves a closer look, as it can help us to better understand the injustices that exist within Chinese society.

Ji Zhongxing was born into an impoverished Shandong province family in 1979. Attempting to help his family make money, and following the popular migrant worker urbanization trend that has swept China, Ji moved to Dongguan, Guangdong to work a manual labor job. In 2005, while in Dongguan, he was allegedly beaten by security guards to the point of paralyzation, however no one has been found guilty in relation to this and no one has come forward as being responsible for this. In an online posting in 2006, Ji wrote that “there is no way to report government injustice.” Because of this, he did not receive any compensation to assist him with medical procedures, or to compensate him for losing his most valuable asset: his body’s ability to conduct manual labor and earn money for his impoverished family. Instead, Ji was forced to borrow all of his relatives’ money to pay for medical expenses. In 2006, he was still 100,000 RMB in debt, and had no means to make more money given his handicapped state.

According to posts on Weibo, Ji Zhongxing had been handing out leaflets in the Beijing airport regarding his paralyzation and attempting to draw attention to his situation and the government’s perceived injustice. However, he was instructed to stop handing these leaflets out, and thus resorted to this July 20 demonstration.

I certainly do not support Ji Zhongxing’s decision to ignite a bomb in the Beijing airport. I simply believe that his story offers a glimpse into alleged Chinese government corruption and injustice.

Sources used include various Chinese netizens Weibo accounts, and the 2006 internet posting by Ji Zhongxing.
